                    Typography is more than just choosing fonts—it's about creating visual hierarchy, 
                    establishing mood, and ensuring readability. Good typography makes the difference 
                    between a website that's merely functional and one that's truly engaging. 
                    In this article, we'll explore the fundamental principles of typography and 
                    how they apply to web design.

            <!-- Main Content -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h3>Understanding Font Families</h3>
                <p class="serif-text">
                    Serif fonts, like Georgia and Times New Roman, are <strong>traditional and formal</strong>. 
                    They work well for long-form content and printed materials. The small decorative strokes 
                    at the ends of letters, called serifs, <mark>guide the eye along lines of text</mark>, 
                    making them easier to read in large blocks.
                </p>

                <p class="sans-serif-text">
                    Sans-serif fonts, such as Arial and Helvetica, are <strong>modern and clean</strong>. 
                    They're perfect for digital screens and provide excellent readability at various sizes. 
                    These fonts <em>convey simplicity and minimalism</em>, making them popular choices 
                    for contemporary web design.
                </p>

                <p class="monospace-text">
                    Monospace fonts like Courier are <strong>ideal for displaying code</strong>. 
                    Each character occupies the same horizontal space, which is <mark>essential for 
                    alignment in programming</mark>. They're also great for creating a technical 
                    or retro aesthetic.
                </p>

                <h3>The Importance of Text Properties</h3>
                <p class="emphasized-text">
                    Proper use of <strong>line-height</strong> and <strong>letter-spacing</strong> 
                    dramatically improves readability. <em>Line-height</em> determines the vertical 
                    space between lines of text, while <em>letter-spacing</em> controls horizontal 
                    space between characters. Together, they create <mark>breathing room</mark> 
                    that prevents text from feeling cramped.
                </p>

                <h3>Creating Visual Hierarchy</h3>
                <p class="hierarchy-text">
                    Visual hierarchy guides readers through content by using different <strong>font sizes</strong>, 
                    <strong>weights</strong>, and <strong>styles</strong>. Headings should be bold and prominent, 
                    while body text should be comfortable to read. <em>Emphasis elements</em> like italic text 
                    draw attention to <mark>important concepts</mark> without disrupting the reading flow.
                </p>

                <h3>Text Alignment and Balance</h3>
                <p class="left-aligned">
                    Left-aligned text is the most common and readable alignment for western languages. 
                    It creates a <strong>strong left edge</strong> that guides the eye down the page, 
                    making it <em>easy to find the start</em> of each new line.
                </p>

                <p class="center-aligned">
                    Center-aligned text works well for headlines, quotes, and short passages. 
                    It creates <strong>symmetry and balance</strong>, but can be <mark>harder to read</mark> 
                    in longer paragraphs because the ragged edges on both sides make it difficult 
                    for the eye to find the beginning of each line.
                </p>

                <p class="right-aligned">
                    Right-aligned text is <em>rarely used for body content</em> but can create 
                    <strong>interesting visual effects</strong> in sidebars, pull quotes, or 
                    captions. It's <mark>unconventional and eye-catching</mark>, making it 
                    effective for special design elements.
                </p>

                <p class="justified">
                    Justified text aligns both left and right edges, creating clean, uniform blocks. 
                    While it looks <strong>neat and professional</strong>, it can create uneven spacing 
                    between words. Use it carefully, as <em>poor justification</em> can reduce readability 
                    by creating <mark>distracting rivers of white space</mark> through the text.
                </p>

                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p class="conclusion-text">
                    Mastering typography is an <strong>essential skill</strong> for any web designer. 
                    By understanding <em>font families</em>, <em>text properties</em>, and <em>alignment options</em>, 
                    you can create <mark>beautiful, readable, and engaging</mark> content that enhances 
                    the user experience. Remember: good typography is invisible—it should help users 
                    consume content without drawing attention to itself.
