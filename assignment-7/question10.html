                        All navigation links feature smooth color and background transitions

                        Interactive hover states provide visual feedback, enhancing user

                    <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        The navigation bar automatically stacks vertically on screens below 
                        700px width, ensuring optimal mobile experience.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="feature-card">
                    <span class="feature-icon">🎯</span>
                    <h3>Active State</h3>
                    <p>
                        The current page is clearly highlighted with a distinct background 
                        color and underline to improve navigation clarity.

        <section class="content-section" id="home">
            <h2>Home Section</h2>
            <p>
                This is the home section of the website. The navigation bar remains fixed at the top 
                as you scroll through the content. The "Home" link in the navbar is highlighted as 
                the active page, making it easy for users to identify their current location.
            </p>
            <p>
                The navbar uses flexbox for layout, ensuring consistent spacing and alignment across 
                different screen sizes. Each link has padding, borders, and carefully crafted hover 
                transitions that create a polished, professional appearance.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section" id="about">
            <h2>About Section</h2>
            <p>
                Our navigation system is built with modern CSS techniques, focusing on accessibility 
                and user experience. The smooth transitions create a seamless interaction that feels 
                natural and responsive to user input.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design emphasizes clarity and usability, with sufficient contrast between text 
                and backgrounds to ensure readability for all users. The hover effects are subtle 
                yet noticeable, providing immediate feedback without being distracting.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section" id="services">
            <h2>Services Section</h2>
            <p>
                The navigation bar's responsive behavior ensures that your site remains accessible 
                on mobile devices. When the viewport width drops below 700px, the horizontal layout 
                transforms into a vertical stack, optimized for touch interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                This adaptive approach demonstrates best practices in modern web design, where 
                content and navigation adjust fluidly to accommodate different device capabilities 
                and screen sizes.
